# Introduction to Neurosignals

***Form Follows Function***
  
There are many different types of neurons that are specialized for signal monitoring, generation, communication and output. All neurons have cell body, axon and dendrites that have functoinally differentiated puirposes. The myelin sheath insulates and speeds the transmission of signals.

***Networks of Chemical and Electrical Circuits***

Cells release action potentials above a spike threshhold stretch that release transmitters that adjust the speed and intensity of output signals. We record from ion channels that open (Na+ flows to increase V for an excited neurotransmitter / Cl- for inhibitory neurotransmitters or mechanical stress and deformation etc.). Released clots of transmitters that diffuse across psynaptic cleffs can be monitored. We drive cells to manipulate circuits and use voltage clamps to measure ion conductance.

***The Logic of Dendrites***

Often we use circuit diagrams (resistors, capacitors, etc.) to model currents of neurons as currents govern voltage. More complex circuits require both feed-forward and feedback inhibitions e.g. flexors and extensors // biceps and triceps work in opposition. Inhibitory interneurons prevent function and excitory neurons trigger function. We can combine these to create logic and compute complicated, dynamic information.

Damage in the circuits means that branches of the larger circuit are closed off. Therefore, we can generate signals but they never come across. Functionally anatomy is import to udnerstand how to augment and treat particular dieseases with BCI. Understand the healthy wiring diagram and you can troubleshoot and treat a damaged one.

***Cortical Architecture is Next Level of Processing***

Structural changes in the brain in any of the lobes that are differentiated to function leads to misfiring of neurons. 

We measure individual action potentials with voltage in cells, extract the action potentials and display them in smoothed waves that filter out through anatomy (see lecture diagrams). With the output of multiple different cells, you receive multi-unit activity spikes and need to filter out through threshold analysis key spikes (massive data and AT LEAST kilo hertz speeds).
