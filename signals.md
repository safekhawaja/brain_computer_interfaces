# Introduction to Neurosignals

***Form Follows Function***
  
There are many different types of neurons that are specialized for signal monitoring, generation, communication and output. All neurons have cell body, axon and dendrites that have functoinally differentiated puirposes. The myelin sheath insulates and speeds the transmission of signals. 
  
***Network of Chemical and Electrical Circuits***

Cells release action potentials above a spike threshhold stretch tthat release transmitters that adjust the speed and intensity of output signals. We record from ion channels that open (Na+ flows to increase V for an excited neurotransmitter / Cl- for inhibitory neurotransmitters or mechanical stress and deformation etc.). Released clots of transmitters that diffuse across psynaptic cleff can be monitored.
