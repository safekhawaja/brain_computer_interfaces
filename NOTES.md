# Introduction to Neurosignals

***Form Follows Function***
  
There are many different types of neurons that are specialized for signal monitoring, generation, communication and output. All neurons have cell body, axon and dendrites that have functoinally differentiated puirposes. The myelin sheath insulates and speeds the transmission of signals.

***Networks of Chemical and Electrical Circuits***

Cells release action potentials above a spike threshhold stretch that release transmitters that adjust the speed and intensity of output signals. We record from ion channels that open (Na+ flows to increase V for an excited neurotransmitter / Cl- for inhibitory neurotransmitters or mechanical stress and deformation etc.). Released clots of transmitters that diffuse across psynaptic cleffs can be monitored. We drive cells to manipulate circuits and use voltage clamps to measure ion conductance.

***The Logic of Dendrites***

Often we use circuit diagrams (resistors, capacitors, etc.) to model currents of neurons as currents govern voltage. More complex circuits require both feed-forward and feedback inhibitions e.g. flexors and extensors // biceps and triceps work in opposition. Inhibitory interneurons prevent function and excitory neurons trigger function. We can combine these to create logic and compute complicated, dynamic information.

Damage in the circuits means that branches of the larger circuit are closed off. Therefore, we can generate signals but they never come across. Functionally anatomy is import to udnerstand how to augment and treat particular dieseases with BCI. Understand the healthy wiring diagram and you can troubleshoot and treat a damaged one.

***Cortical Architecture is Next Level of Processing***

Structural changes in the brain in any of the lobes that are differentiated to function leads to misfiring of neurons. 

We measure individual action potentials with voltage in cells, extract the action potentials and display them in smoothed waves that filter out through anatomy (see lecture diagrams). With the output of multiple different cells, you receive multi-unit activity spikes and need to filter out through threshold analysis key spikes (massive data and AT LEAST kilo hertz speeds).

***Signal Recording***

Multi-unit activity (spikes) come from synchronous multiple cellular outputs - normally in kHz range with lowest spatial processing. Local field potentials are one order of activity higher: they are networked inputs to receptors wiht much higher level signals. 

Field potentials (EEG) can be intra and extracranial, and they can be recorded through average or smeared readings. EEGs are generated by groups of cells that generate voltages through dipole fields. Locations on the head are labelled as X# (X letter # number) where each letter is a different part of the brain and odd is on the left side and even on the right. Recorded signals vary in frequency (Alpha awake to Delta sleep/drowsy).

Somatosensory EPs are where body nerves are stimulated and synchronously EEG recordings are taken in the brain and spine to detect localized psynapes and generate waveforms.Particularly for vision and auditory pathways, there are more complex set ups for recording signals. 

When breaking down signals, the key ideas to remember are to know what you're recording and why (know your neuroanatomy!), reduce the data where you can, learn the network architecture, and communicate your technique concisely.

***Talking to Neurons***

Neurons generate and are affected by electric fields (we can inject signals as well as read) â€” what makes them special is their ability to *change* the permeability of the ion channels. Cell membranes are filled with proteins (many of which are ion channels) that make **capacitors** with diffusion gradients. Membranes can actually be modelled with Kirchoff's laws and parallel conductance models. 

The two forces are the diffusion force and the electrical force across the neurons. The ions in solution can charge so generate fields. Ions themselves like to equalize concentration and so diffuse to spread. The membrane walls are made of lipid bilayers which are semi-permeable so ions can diffuse across. Various ions are across each side in different concentrations, which build up the calculable Nernst potential across.

Action potentials are all or nothing unidirectional events when concentration crosses a threshold on electrical psynapes. The conductance is governed by the channel and can change quickly! The neurotansmitter binds to the subsequent cell, and the previous gate closes. Na+ jumps from node-to-node in myelin around axons. 

Bottom line: we need to figure out which circuits are important for us to facillitate or reduce activity.
